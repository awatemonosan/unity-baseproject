# base-unity-project

**UPDATE:** this project is out of date and no longer maintained. For my most recent unity framework check out my unity-essentials repo


A Couple notes about source control:
Note that the only root folders you need to keep under source control are Assets and ProjectSettings.
The media folder is intented to hold large media files and they don't get along well with GIT.
Do not commit the media folder. Share your media folder on a dropbox account and share the files there.
